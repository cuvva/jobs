## About Cuvva

Insurance is the next big area within finance to get disrupted and we have been backed by [some incredible VCs](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cuvva) to take on one huge part of it.

Ever thought the premium you pay for your car insurance is opaque and unfair? Well, thatâ€™s because it is. At Cuvva we have fixed this by allowing you to insure yourself on a car for as little as an hour, via an app. No more meerkat toys, no more singing tenors, we have cut out all the middlemen and built our own platform to distribute insurance on mobile.

As a tech-driven company, we are changing the way people engage with their insurance company, the way they buy insurance, and the way they think about borrowing a car.

## The job

We're looking for a senior software engineer who has lead engineering teams within high-growth, high-scale startups, operating with complete autonomy, ensuring impeccable reliability and availability. You care deeply about building rock-solid infrastructure for the long term, with a track record of delivering solutions which support the whole team, and your product.

You will create and own Cuvva's core platform, abstracting the key processes required to sell insurance, delivering solutions that allow the team to develop strong and stable products, without having to spend time ensuring they get the basics right.

Aside from developing core platform services, we expect you will also become heavily involved with ops and security activities, contributing towards the maintenance of our servers, AWS account, etc. These would likely become some of your main responsibilities over time. (Though initially focusing more on the platform.)

## "Core platform"

When we refer to the "core platform", we mean the services which underpin the processes of all insurance activities on our system.

For example, we expect one of these to be the "policy service", which might be responsible for ensuring compliant issuance of policies, coordinating mid-term adjustments, preventing overlapping policies (double insurance), etc.

Other services could include user authentication, risk & pricing calculation, handling the process of modifying user data in-line with any mid-term adjustment requirements.

All services we consider to be part of the core platform will have extremely strict requirements around stability, data integrity and transactional safety. All functionality must fail safely and explicitly, for example using 2-phase commit processes or other similar techniques. This will also require a reasonable level of testing to validate this safety.

## Responsibilities

You will be responsible for:

- establishing and maintaining our "core platform"
- planning and implementing solutions in response to team needs
- developing practices and processes for our back-end systems
- working with the rest of our engineering team to develop their skills
- contributing towards customer operations and support activities (it's important to us that everyone does this occasionally)

## Requirements

The perfect addition to our team will have:

- a fiercely independent and self-driven approach
- 5+ years commercial experience working on back-end systems at high-scale startups
- strong knowledge of security practices, ideally with a slightly grey-hat background
- deep understanding of the internals of JavaScript and Node (particularly ES6/Babel/etc.)
- knowledge of the entire web stack - from how DNS lookups are transmitted, to how browsers prioritize CSS rules
- awareness of compliance and financial regulation
- a deep-rooted love of South Park, along with other satire and dark humor

We are a small team so it is important that the successful candidate is not only technically highly competent, but also a great cultural fit!
