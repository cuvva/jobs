## About Cuvva

Insurance is the next big industry to get disrupted, and Cuvva is starting with
the way you think about car insurance. We have built an app that lets you insure
yourself on a friend's car for as little as an hour, and that's just the
beginning. We cut out all the middle-men and built our own platform for
distributing insurance on mobile. We're using it to change the way people engage
with their insurance company, the way they buy insurance, and the way they think
about borrowing a car.

If you think you have what it takes to raise our game and you're interested in
dynamic risk profiling, live marketplaces, behavioural psychology and cool
hardware integrations then [we should talk](mailto:jobs@cuvva.co).

Cuvva is seed funded (&pound;500k to date), currently in the Barclays/Techstars
fin-tech accelerator. We're a team of five full and part-time people, and we're
hiring!

## The Job

We are looking for an experienced iOS engineer who will lay the foundations for
the next couple of years of the user-facing side of Cuvva's platform. You will
have experience building complex apps in a modular fashion with elegance and
simplicity, while leading other engineers at the same time. You care deeply
about building rock-solid infrastructure for the long term, with a track record
of delivering solutions which support your team and product.

Cuvva as seen by our customers will be created and owned by you, managing the
delivery of our user experience end-to-end. You will also regularly prototype
new concepts and research new technology, with a view to incorporating it into
our long term plans. You will put practices and infrastructure into place which
will support and lead your team as it grows.

You will be responsible for:

- developing practices and procedures for our use of Apple platforms
- laying the foundations for a codebase which will be in production for multiple years
- bringing our new design concepts to realisation (let us know if you'd like a peek!)
- working with our team to develop their skills
- eventually building out a team of your own

The perfect addition to our team will have:

- a fiercely independent and self-driven approach
- 2+ years of leading mobile engineering at high-scale companies
- played with iOS since its early days
- more ideas than they know what to do with
- a strong understanding of tech startups and what it means to work in this environment
- awareness of compliance and financial regulation
