## About Cuvva

The next big area within finance to get disrupted, insurance is ripe for
innovation, and Cuvva is starting with car insurance.

Ever thought the premium for your car insurance is opaque and unfair? Well,
that's because it is. At Cuvva we have fixed this by allowing you to insure
yourself on a car for as little as an hour, via an app.

No more meerkat toys, no more singing tenors, we have cut out all the middlemen
and built our own platform from scratch for distributing insurance. We're using
it to change the way people buy and use insurance, and the way they think about
getting from A-to-B. It's all about providing insurance that fits.

If you think you have what it takes to raise our game and you're interested in
dynamic risk profiling, real-time marketplace competition, behavioural
psychology, cool hardware integrations and automated emergency/crash detection,
then [we should talk](mailto:jobs@cuvva.co).

Cuvva is seed funded (&pound;500k to date), and has recently completed the
Barclays/Techstars fintech accelerator. We are currently fundraising with a view
to scaling the business quickly over the next 12-18 months. We're a team of
eight full and part-time people, and we're hiring!

## The Job

We are looking for someone with 5+ years experience to be Head of Marketing. You
will be joining the management team of Cuvva, and will play an integral role in
helping grow the business alongside our co-founders.

Ideally, you will have experience at an early stage B2C company, (think
Transferwise / Nutmeg / GoCardless), scaling from initial product-market fit to
series A and beyond. You will have both a strong understanding of mobile digital
and above the line marketing. We are looking to grow the business rapidly, and
expect our Head of Marketing to build a marketing strategy that incorporates
both digital and non-digital marketing channels as we target different audiences
during the product lifecycle.

An important element of the role will be building the Cuvva brand. You will be
challenged to grow brand awareness at the same time as targeting specific goals
around key criteria such as Customer Acquisition Cost and Lifetime Value, within
a defined budget.

You will work closely with the product team with regard to product development,
leveraging customer insight gained through, for example, testing our value
proposition with key target audiences.

An experimental mentality is critical. You will be able to hypothesise, design
and run rigorous experiments live on our platform, and importantly you will be
able to explain the inputs and outputs of this process to any of the rest of the
team, board and investors.

You will be responsible for:

-	creating and shaping Cuvva's marketing and PR strategy
-	discovering and testing new acquisition channels
-	ideation, creation, and management of user acquisition campaigns
-	analysing user behaviours, conversion data, customer journeys and usage data
-	building partnerships to leverage other brands/products/channels
-	working closely with the rest of the team, including product, technical and finance

Some specific skills you will need:

-	performance marketing including management of paid acquisition campaigns on social and paid search, reporting and analysis
-	community building on social
-	coordinating guerrilla marketing campaigns
-	experience marketing via TV, print, radio
-	attribution models
-	analytics (e.g. Mixpanel / Appsflyer, funnel setup)
-	A/B split and multivariate testing
-	Excel

We are a small team so it is important that the successful candidate is not only
technically highly competent, but also a great cultural fit!
