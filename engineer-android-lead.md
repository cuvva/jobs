## About Cuvva

The next big area within finance to get disrupted, insurance is ripe for
innovation, and Cuvva is starting with car insurance.

Ever thought the premium for your car insurance is opaque and unfair? Well,
that's because it is. At Cuvva we have fixed this by allowing you to insure
yourself on a car for as little as an hour, via an app.

No more meerkat toys, no more singing tenors, we have cut out all the middlemen
and built our own platform from scratch for distributing insurance. We're using
it to change the way people buy and use insurance, and the way they think about
getting from A-to-B. It's all about providing insurance that fits.

If you think you have what it takes to raise our game and you're interested in
dynamic risk profiling, real-time marketplace competition, behavioural
psychology, cool hardware integrations and automated emergency/crash detection,
then [we should talk](mailto:jobs@cuvva.co).

Cuvva is seed funded (&pound;500k to date), and has recently completed the
Barclays/Techstars fintech accelerator. We are currently fundraising with a view
to scaling the business quickly over the next 12-18 months. We're a team of
eight full and part-time people, and we're hiring!

## The Job

We are looking for an experienced Android engineer who will lay the foundations
for the next couple of years of the user-facing side of Cuvva's platform. You
will have experience building complex apps in a modular fashion with elegance
and simplicity, while leading other engineers at the same time. You care deeply
about building rock-solid infrastructure for the long term, with a track record
of delivering solutions which support your team and product.

Cuvva as seen by our customers will be created and owned by you, managing the
delivery of our user experience end-to-end. You will also regularly prototype
new concepts and research new technology, with a view to incorporating it into
our long term plans. You will put practices and infrastructure into place which
will support and lead your team as it grows.

You will be responsible for:

- developing practices and procedures for our use of Android platforms
- laying the foundations for a codebase which will be in production for multiple years
- bringing our new design concepts to realisation (let us know if you'd like a peek!)
- collaborating with our platform team to spec out API requirements
- working with our team to develop their skills
- eventually building out a team of your own
- helping customers and fixing any problems they have (everyone does support)

The perfect addition to our team will have:

- a fiercely independent and self-driven approach
- 2+ years of leading mobile engineering at high-scale companies
- played with Android since its early days
- experience dealing with adapting tightly defined designs for responsive display
- a deep-rooted love of South Park, along with other satire and dark humor
- more ideas than they know what to do with
- a strong understanding of tech startups and what it means to work in this environment
- awareness of compliance and financial regulation

We are a small team so it is important that the successful candidate is not only
technically highly competent, but also a great cultural fit!
