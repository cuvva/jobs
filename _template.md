## About Cuvva

Insurance is the next big industry to get disrupted, and Cuvva is starting with
car insurance. We have an app which lets you insure yourself on a friend's car
for as little as an hour, but that's just the beginning. So far, we've cut out
all the middle-men and built our own platform from scratch for distributing
insurance. We're using it to change the way people buy and use insurance, and
the way they think about getting from A-to-B. It's all about providing insurance
that fits.

If you think you have what it takes to raise our game and you're interested in
dynamic risk profiling, real-time marketplace competition, behavioural
psychology, cool hardware integrations and automated emergency/crash detection,
then [we should talk](mailto:jobs@cuvva.co).

Cuvva is well funded, and is part of the Techstars family (Barclays Accelerator,
Q1 2016). We're a team of eight full and part-time people, and we're hiring!
