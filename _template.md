## About Cuvva

Insurance is the next big industry to get disrupted, and Cuvva is starting with
the way you think about car insurance. We have built an app that lets you insure
yourself on a friend's car for as little as an hour, and that's just the
beginning. We cut out all the middle-men and built our own platform for
distributing insurance on mobile. We're using it to change the way people engage
with their insurance company, the way they buy insurance, and the way they think
about borrowing a car.

If you think you have what it takes to raise our game and you're interested in
dynamic risk profiling, live marketplaces, behavioural psychology and cool
hardware integrations then [we should talk](mailto:jobs@cuvva.co).

Cuvva is seed funded (&pound;500k to date), currently in the Barclays/Techstars
fin-tech accelerator. We're a team of five full and part-time people, and we're
hiring!
