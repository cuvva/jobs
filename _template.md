## About Cuvva

The next big area within finance to get disrupted, insurance is ripe for
innovation, and Cuvva is starting with car insurance.

Ever thought the premium for your car insurance is opaque and unfair? Well,
that's because it is. At Cuvva we have fixed this by allowing you to insure
yourself on a car for as little as an hour, via an app.

No more meerkat toys, no more singing tenors, we have cut out all the middlemen
and built our own platform from scratch for distributing insurance. We're using
it to change the way people buy and use insurance, and the way they think about
getting from A-to-B. It's all about providing insurance that fits.

If you think you have what it takes to raise our game and you're interested in
dynamic risk profiling, real-time marketplace competition, behavioural
psychology, cool hardware integrations and automated emergency/crash detection,
then [we should talk](mailto:jobs@cuvva.co).

Cuvva is seed funded (&pound;500k to date), and has recently completed the
Barclays/Techstars fintech accelerator. We are currently fundraising with a view
to scaling the business quickly over the next 12-18 months. We're a team of
eight full and part-time people, and we're hiring!
